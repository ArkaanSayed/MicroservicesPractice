For testing we need the following packages ==>
"@types/jest": "^28.1.6",
"@types/supertest": "^2.0.12",
"jest": "^28.1.3",
"mongodb-memory-server": "^8.8.0",
"supertest": "^6.2.4",
"ts-jest": "^28.0.7"
_Ignore the version numbers_

Create a test folder and have a setup.ts to setup the tests also have a "jest" configure in package.json
When we run test via jest the jest package will look for **test** folder and execute each file with the extension .test.ts / .test.js !!
It will run all the it('', async () => {}) functions which has a callback !!

Now typescript to make it run we need to convert it into corresponding js files !!
So the command tsc is used to do that it converts the .ts files into .js files and .d.ts files
Now we can specify which directory to build the .js and its corresponding .d.ts files in the package.json file
